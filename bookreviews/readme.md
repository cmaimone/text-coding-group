# Info

Code in this directory is for the October 5, 2018 meeting of the [Text Analysis Working Group](https://sites.northwestern.edu/tawg/).  We're collecting data from https://www.rtbookreviews.com/book-review.

You can use R or Python.  Packages to install:

**R**:

# Notes

The files with `_together` in them are the ones we wrote together in the workshop.  They are a little different from the files I wrote in preparation before the workshop.  There are multiple ways to go about doing the task.

The prepared files have some comments in them.  The `_together` files don't.

If you're going to try this on your own, please don't collect all 1282 pages of book reviews, and the thousands of reviews.  Update the code to just collect a few of the pages listing reviews to just practice with.

You need to make the folders/directories you're going to download files into first before trying to save files to them.

See [steps.md](steps.md) for an overview of the steps involved in collecting data from a website, a few links, etc.
