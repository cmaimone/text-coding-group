# Python Resources

We're using [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html) which is great for basic text processing tasks.  It's built on top of nltk.

THe NLTK online book shows you how to do a lot of these things too: https://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html.  NLTK is the traditional text processing package for Python.

[spaCy](https://spacy.io/) is another text processing package which can do lots of stuff; this is where I'd start for more complicated tasks that TextBlob can't handle.
